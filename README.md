# Deployr 💾

Deployr helps you host your Next.js application on your own aws ec2 instance, With just a few clicks, you can set up everything, from machine provisioning to serving your next application on your own domain.

Here is a video walkthrough / how to use Deployr: [Deployr Walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/8c7ca17efc78416d8bec92d46bc482ae?sid=10439ae0-bdd7-4ce3-ae1e-85ea4ef9da86)

# How to Deployr Your App 🚀

v1.0.0 is here 🎉

How to use Deployr to host your Next.js application on your own AWS EC2 instance:

### Step 1: Get the project:

#### Linux (Intel/AMD64):
```bash
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/deployr https://github.com/adityacodes30/deployr/releases/download/v1.0.0/deployr-linux-amd64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deployr
```

#### macOS (ARM/M1)
```bash
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/deployr https://github.com/adityacodes30/deployr/releases/download/v1.0.0/deployr-macos-arm64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deployr
```

#### Linux (ARM64):
```bash
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/deployr https://github.com/adityacodes30/deployr/releases/download/v1.0.0/deployr-linux-arm64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deployr
```

#### macOS (Intel/AMD64):
```bash
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/deployr https://github.com/adityacodes30/deployr/releases/download/v1.0.0/deployr-macos-amd64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deployr
```

### Step 2: Test the installation 

```bash
deployr -v
```

You should see the version of the deployr you just installed

### Step 3: Create a config.yml file 

Download the `config.example.yml` file and obtain your AWS credentials and the github repo of your next app to be deployr(ed) 

Sign into aws and make a IAM user with the following policy attached: 

```json 
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "deployr",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",
				"ec2:DescribeInstances",
				"ec2:StartInstances",
				"ec2:CreateTags",
				"ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
				"ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
				"ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
				"ec2:DescribeSubnets",
				"ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
				"ec2:StopInstances",
				"ec2:TerminateInstances",
				"ec2:RebootInstances",
				"ec2:RunInstances"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

Then obtain and add the credentials of the user you just created as well as the github repo of your next app to be deployr(ed) to the config.example.yml 

Then rename `config.example.yml` ---> `config.yml`

Here is a short [guide](https://www.loom.com/share/cf21a3c2212b45f887e46d73544dabd6?sid=00f3bd28-689c-4480-931d-bd5c4cca247b) on how to do that 

### Step 4: Run the deployr command 

```bash
deployr <path-to-config.yml>
```

### Step 5: Point your domain 

You will get your public IP in your terminal, go to your domain hosting provider and point your domain to that IP 

### Step 6: Your project is Deployed 

You can now access your project on your domain after a few minutes ( Depending on the buildtime of your project )

## If you want to build 

### Step 1: Clone the Project  
Start by cloning the Deployr repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-deployr-repo-url>
cd deployr
```

### Step 2: Install Go

Ensure that Go is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Go website. Verify the installation:

```bash
go version
```

### Step 3: Get Credentials

Sign into aws and make a IAM user with the following policy attached: 

```json 
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "deployr",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",
				"ec2:DescribeInstances",
				"ec2:StartInstances",
				"ec2:CreateTags",
				"ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
				"ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
				"ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
				"ec2:DescribeSubnets",
				"ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
				"ec2:StopInstances",
				"ec2:TerminateInstances",
				"ec2:RebootInstances",
				"ec2:RunInstances"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

Then obtain and add the credentials of the user you just created as well as the github repo of your next app to be deployr(ed) to the config.example.yml 

Then rename `config.example.yml` ---> `config.yml`

Here is a short [guide](https://www.loom.com/share/cf21a3c2212b45f887e46d73544dabd6?sid=00f3bd28-689c-4480-931d-bd5c4cca247b) on how to do that 


### Step 4: Build and run the project 

Run the command

```bash
go build main.go 
```

### Step 5: Point your domain 

You will get your public IP in your terminal, go to your domain hosting provider and point your domain to that IP 

### Step 6: Your project is Deployed 

You can now access your project on your domain after a few minutes ( Depending on the buildtime of your project )


### Development progress

This checklist tracks the current state of tasks. There will be a hosted build for all platforms soon. Currently you can build from source and use it
